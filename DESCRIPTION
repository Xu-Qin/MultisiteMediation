Description: This package enables causal mediation analysis in multisite trials, in which individuals are assigned to a treatment or a control group at each site. It allows for estimation and hypothesis testing for not only the population average but also the between-site variance of direct and indirect effects. This strategy conveniently relaxes the assumption of no treatment-by-mediator interaction while greatly simplifying the outcome model specification without invoking strong distributional assumptions.
